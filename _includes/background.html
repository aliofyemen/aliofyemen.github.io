    <blockquote lang="en">I'm a person who loves to learn new things and discover new experiences which has allowed me to be well-rounded in more than one field of computer science. I consider myself as a person who is adaptable and not afraid to try new technologies. You can see in my projects section that I have dabbled with anything from high-level programming (front-end software development) to low-level programming (real-time embedded systems development.)</blockquote>

    <blockquote><strong>When I'm not glued to my computer screen</strong>, I'm probably playing or watching soccer, reading fiction, or learning new languages (currently learning Japanese.) But not necessarily doing those things in that order.</blockquote>
