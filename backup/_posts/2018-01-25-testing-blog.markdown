title: Testing Blog
layout: post
---

This is just dummy content to test the blog capabilities of the site. For instance, we can add `code` tags like so. We can also add `code` blocks like the following:

{% highlight java linenos%}
{% raw %}
class Dummy{
	public Dummy{
		//dummy constructor
	}
}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Very powerfull features indeed, gotta love Jekyll.
